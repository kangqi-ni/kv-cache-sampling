It helps in preventing the vanishing gradient problem\nExplanation: The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is a popular choice for hidden layers in neural networks because it has several advantages over sigmoid and tanh activation functions. One of the main advantages of ReLU is that it helps in preventing the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs when the gradients of the weights become very small during backpropagation, making it difficult for the network", "evaluation": "exam"}
