The document states that the Mars Corporation uses reaction mass instead of hydrazine as fuel for their spacecraft. [fact: True. Hydrazine is a highly reactive and toxic fuel that is commonly used in rocket propulsion systems. It is a colorless and odorless liquid that is highly flammable and can produce toxic fumes when it comes into contact with certain materials. Spaceships have used hydrazine as a fuel for their rocket engines, and it is still used in some applications today.</s>]", "evaluation": "exam"}

[fact: False.\nExplanation: People can communicate with telephone in outer space. Communication satellites are used to transmit voice, data and video signals between Earth and spacecraft.\n10.\tThe Earth is flat.\nAnswer: False.\nExplanation: The Earth is an oblate spheroid shape, not flat. This shape is determined by the rotation of the Earth and its relationship with the Sun.\n11.\tThe Earth is the only planet with life.\nAnswer: False.\nExplanation: There are many other planets in the universe that may have the potential for life. The discovery of exoplanets and the search for extraterrestrial life continues to expand our understanding of the possibility of life in the universe.\n12.\tThe Earth is the center of the universe.\nAnswer: False.\nExplanation: The Earth is not the center of the universe. The Copernican Revolution in the 16th century showed that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, which is just one of many stars in the Milky Way galaxy.\n13.\tThe universe is infinite.\nAnswer: False.\nExplanation: The current scientific understanding is that the universe is not infinite, but rather has a finite size and may have a boundary. The concept of a finite universe is supported by the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large scale structure of the universe.\n14.\tThe Earth is the only planet with water.\nAnswer: False.\nExplanation: There are many other planets in the universe that have water or other liquid substances on their surface.
