It is computationally more efficient than sigmoid because it does not require any saturation or clipping of the output. This means that ReLU can be used with any input value, whereas sigmoid can only take values between 0 and 1.

Applying dropout regularization.\n\nExplanation: The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients of the weights become very small, making it difficult for the network to learn. Dropout regularization is a technique that helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by randomly dropping out some of the neurons during training. This helps to prevent the gradients from becoming too small and improves the stability of the network.\n\nA. Using ReLU activation functions instead of sigmoid activation functions can also help to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, as ReLU functions have a higher gradient magnitude than sigmoid functions.\nB. Initializing weights to small random values can also help to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, as it can prevent the gradients from becoming too small.\nC.

The learning rate is the rate at which the model updates its parameters during training. A high learning rate can cause the model to overshoot the optimal solution, while a low learning rate can cause the model to converge too slowly.

For example, if a researcher only surveys people who attend a particular church, the sample may not be representative of the population as a whole.\n* Stratified sampling: If the sample is not stratified, meaning that it is not divided into subgroups based on certain characteristics, it may not be representative of the population as a whole.

Between 75% and 80%\nExplanation: The margin of error for the survey is 5%, which means that if we were to repeat the survey multiple times, we would expect the true percentage of respondents who would buy the product again to fall within a range of plus or minus 5% of the reported percentage of 75%.\n\nTo calculate the range, we can use the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom (where n is the sample size) and a significance level of 0.05. The t-distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nThe t-value for a 95% confidence level and a sample size of 75 is approximately 2.008.\n\nThe range of the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.96 times the t-value.\n\nTherefore, the range of the true percentage of respondents who would buy the product again is approximately 1.96 x 2.008 = 3.936.\n\nSince the reported percentage of respondents who would buy the product again is 75%, the true percentage is likely to be within the range of 75% - 3.936 = 71.064% and 75% + 3.936 = 78.936%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is between 75% and 80%.", "evaluation": "exam"}

USER: Now you are given a very long document. Please follow the instruction based on this document. For multi-choice questions, there could be a sinlge correct option or multiple correct options. Please only provide the letter corresponding to the answer (like A or AB) when answering. Document is as follows. {document} \nQuestion: {inst}  \nAnswer:", "vicuna1.3-7b-200k_pred": "D and C\nExplanation:\nRaising the keep\\_prob parameter from 0.5 to 0.6 will result in a lower training set error for the neural network. This is because the model will be less likely to be pruned during training, allowing it to learn more from the data and potentially improve its performance. However, it is also possible that the regularization effect of dropout may be diminished, which could result in a higher training set error. Therefore, the most accurate responses are D and C.", "evaluation": "exam"}
